🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game (Python)

📝 Description

A simple, terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game built with Python! Two players can play against each other, selecting positions on a 3x3 grid until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
The game is designed to be intuitive, showing an empty board with cell positions, and updating the board after each turn. It even lets you play again if you want a rematch!

🛠️ Features

- 2-Player Mode: Player 1 vs Player 2.
- Dynamic Board Display: See the board update live after each move.
- Input Validation: Prevents invalid or duplicate inputs.
- Win/Draw Detection: Instantly announces a winner or draw.
- Screen Clearing (Jupyter Notebooks): Keeps the interface clean.
- Replay Option: Start a new game without restarting the script.

🧩 How to Play

- Players choose either 'x' or 'y'.
- The initial board shows positions 0-8.
- Players take turns selecting a cell (0–8).
- The board updates after each move, and the game checks for a winner.
- If all cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
- After the game, you can choose to play again or exit.

🎯 Winning Conditions

- A player wins if they align 3 of their symbols:
- Horizontally: Rows 0, 1, 2 or 3, 4, 5, etc.
- Vertically: Columns 0, 3, 6 or 1, 4, 7, etc.
- Diagonally: 0, 4, 8 or 6, 4, 2
